            <p>Island ingredients have been used for centuries to fuel the bodies of fishermen, surfers, and travelers. Today we harness that heritage in a modern, convenient can.</p>
            <h3>The Power of Kelp</h3>
            <p>Kelp is rich in iodine, iron, and trace minerals that support metabolism and thyroid health. Unlike synthetic additives, kelp delivers a clean, sustained energy release.</p>
            <h3>Coconut Water Hydration</h3>
            <p>Natural electrolytes from coconut water keep you hydrated without the sugary crash of many sports drinks.</p>
            <h3>Tropical Fruit Flavour</h3>
            <p>A splash of passion fruit and mango gives a bright, refreshing finish that reminds you of a beach sunrise.</p>
            <p>Combine these three powerhouses, and you have a drink that fuels performance while honoring the island’s natural bounty.</p>

            <p>Garudhiya, a clear fish broth, has been a staple of Maldivian cuisine for generations. Traditionally prepared with freshly caught tuna, the soup reflects the islands’ reliance on the sea.</p>
            <p>Historically, families would gather at dawn to clean and fillet the fish, then simmer it with a handful of aromatic herbs. The simplicity of the broth highlights the quality of the fish itself.</p>
            <p>Today, modern kitchens preserve the same technique, but many chefs experiment with additional herbs like curry leaves or lemongrass to add a contemporary twist.</p>
