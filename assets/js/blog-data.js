            <p>Ever wondered how we transform traditional island ingredients into a modern energy drink? Here's an exclusive look at our process.</p>
            <h3>Tuna Harvesting</h3>
            <p>We partner with sustainable Tuna farms in the North Atolls, where tuna is hand-harvested and stroked at peak nutrient density. The tuna is dried within hours to preserve its mineral content.</p>
            <h3>Coconut Water Extraction</h3>
            <p>Young coconuts are sourced from local growers and processed the same day. We use a cold-press method to maintain natural electrolyte balance.</p>
            <h3>Flavor Infusion</h3>
            <p>Curry leaves and tropical fruit essences are carefully blended to create our signature taste. Each batch is tested for flavor consistency and nutritional content.</p>
            <h3>Quality Control</h3>
            <p>Before canning, every batch undergoes rigorous testing for purity, pH balance, and mineral content. We're committed to delivering the same quality in every can.</p>
